# Rhymer
![rhymer](rhymer.png)

An Electron application to help you write lyrics.

## Help me write lyrics?

Yeah! Poetry, rap, 2019-post-modern-ska-but-with-more-flutes? Whatever you want to write, Rhymer helps!

### What does it do?

Rhymer offers two main features:

1. Syllable count.
2. Rhyming dictionary.

Rhymer gives syllable counts on a per-line basis. Where most text editors would show the line number, Rhymer instead shows the syllable count for that line. Rhymer also provides an automatic rhyming dictionary; it will show you the rhymes for the word before the current cursor position or for the currently highlighted word.
